Problem 1: Counting the Uppercase / Lowercase Words in a Text

Write a program that counts the words in a text entered from the console. The program must output the total number of words, the number of words written in uppercase and the number of words written in lowercase. If a word appears more than once in the text, each repetition counts as a new occurrence. Every character that is not a letter counts as a word separator.
Sample input:

"Welcome to your first programming exam! Can you think of a solution to this problem and write it down? GOOD LUCK!"
Sample output:

Word count: 21
Upper case words: 2
Lower case words: 17ï»¿
